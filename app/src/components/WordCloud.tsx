        Word Clouds - Rap Artists
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        These word clouds reflect linguistic patterns across rap communities.

        and assertive expressions. The visuals below highlight these
        distinctions.

          General Observations:
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          Pop lyrics tend to focus on emotional themes like love, relationships,
          and personal expression. Words like "love", "your", and "im" are
          common across many communities.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          In contrast, rap lyrics often include street slang, expressions of
          power, profanity and racial slurs. Common terms include "got",
          "bitch", "like", and "yeah".

          Distinct Communities Identified:
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          One rap community stood out with a clear connection to street-oriented
          or trap music. The words used here, like "rack", "bustin", and "push",
          align with modern trap themes. Additionally artists such as Future and
          21 Savage are associated with trap, mumble flows, and dark, melodic
          beats.
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          A pop community centered around artists like Ariana Grande and Bruno
          Mars displayed softer, melodic tendencies - closely linked to R&B
          vocal style.

          Suggestions for Improvement:
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          Some of the most common words in both genres are simply repeated sound
          effects like "dudu", "ye_ye", or "woo". These can clutter the
          analysis. A more advanced cleanup step would help highlight meaningful
          themes better.
