            it to the Spotify weekly charts and ~136k additional artists who had
            at least one feature with at least one of the chart artists. As a

            Given the extensive size of the overall collaboration network, we
            decided to narrow our focus by concentrating on the most-listened
            artists within the United States. To achieve this, we incorporated

            dataset, also available on Kaggle. This allowed us to define a more
            targeted scope for our analysisâ€”prioritizing influential artists
            while excluding lesser-known figures whose limited reach would
            contribute minimally to our study of collaboration patterns.
