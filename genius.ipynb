Both `RAP_NA` and `POP_NA` exhibit statistically significant community structes, as indicated by modularity scores exceding those of their relative 1000 null models. Although POP_NA showed a slightly higher modularity, we avoid direct comparison due to the differences in network size and density. Additionally both networks showed reduced degree dissortativity relative to the null models, though assortativity remains low overall, which is likely a result of well connected artists collaborating across the popularity spectrum. \n",

In the POP_NA network, the weaker correlation may reflect that popularity in this genre is driven more by external factors such as label promotion or individual success rather than a good network position"
